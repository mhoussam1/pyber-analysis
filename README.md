# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of Project
# Background: 

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

The analysis preformed compares the previous school district analysis against this firm's analysis in order to find out and determine how academic dishonesty affects the school’s performance. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### 	How is the district summary affected?
The district summary is affected as the clean version for the data removes a total of 461 results from the 9th graders from Thomas High School, which in turn has a huge effect on the averages and the percentages. The percentages are seen to drop because of the changes which are the removal of the data. 

### 	How is the school summary affected?

We see that the school summary is affected when it comes to the percentages for math, reading and the overall grades. Once the grades for the 9th grade are removed. We can see that there is the Thomas high school they jump to the 2nd, the totals for the 10th till the 12th grade percentages. They can be seen on the pictures. 

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School's overall performance is seen to be better and jumps to the 2nd on the list, moving down a lot of schools. 

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade

Because Thomas High School ninth graders are labeled as nan in both math and reading. This creates a void in the data and makes them be seen as an outlier. Because those results make a big effect on the percentages. 

- Scores by school spending
From the graph we are able to see that the campaigns with goals less then 20k and between 35-45k have a higher percentage of successful campaigns while campaigns with goals greater then 45k or between 20-35k showed a higher percentage of failed campaigns. There was no record of any canceled campaigns therefore it was not shown on the graph. 


- Scores by school size


All the percentages went down for all the different sized school groups, especially shown on the small and medium sized schools. 



- Scores by school type

The percentages are also seen to be dropping for both school types, showing decreases in all subjects.
